# Welcome to BombSquad Aeon Mods

## What is it?

This is a mod for the game [BombSquad](http://www.froemling.net/apps/bombsquad) by [Eric Froemling](http://www.froemling.net/about) that aims to improve the management of community created content for BombSquad. Inspired by work [Mrmaxmeier](https://github.com/Mrmaxmeier). I rewrote a brand new version of ModManager.

Using both official and Eric's apis so it should work in all platforms.

Only for BombSquad 1.5.23 and Higher. (Due to plugin support)

## Installation

I haven't prepare the specific installation file. You need to manually download [ModManager.py](https://github.com/EternalARK/BombSquad_Aeon_Mods/blob/master/ba_mods/ModManager/ModManager.py)

manually and put it in the mod folder. Then you have to activate it in the Advance Setting window of BombSquad.

This is what the basic interface looks like.



This mod manager is designed to handle multi-source support.

Each tab is a panel to manage mods from different source.
